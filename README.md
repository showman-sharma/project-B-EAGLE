# Project B-EAGLE

## Abstract
As gas is going to become an important source of power as the world moves towards a cleaner future, more and more
processes & systems will be powered by CNG, LPG, methane and even hydrogen. Along with this, a variety of gases are already in use in
the industrial & production sector. As these gases are mostly hazardous or inflammable, in this paper we have suggested an IOT-based
gas leakage detection system which monitors concentration of some target gas in a space, finds the source and reports it to prevent
accidents. We have done a thorough analysis of the problem, and suggested multiple solutions for different cases & different scales.

## Proposal
We propose a leak source search system mounted on small sized drones or rovers that will accurately reach the source of the gas leak or fire. Subsequently, the drone/rover might act as a beacon locating the source exactly or could manage the hazard if relevantly equipped. Here, we try: 
- To create a Gas Leak Source Search System. 
- To equip a drone with this system and make it reach the source.
- This drone would act like a beacon, informing the user about the exact location of the source.
